## Background

My previous employer, who runs a small business selling welding products, asked me to make a spreadsheet to tell him how much inventory to order based on the number of products sold. It sounded like the perfect task for an app to do. Monitoring inventory through the app instead of a spreasheet will hopefully eliminate unnecessary errors and make it easier for the business to scale and track useful trends.
